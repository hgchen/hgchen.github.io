I lead the computational imaging team at Vayu Robotics, where we aim to use novel imaging techniques and
apparatus to improve the perception of autonomous vehicles. 

Before Vayu, I was a senior research scientist and tech lead manager at
[SenseBrain Technology](https://www.sensebrain.ai/). My team tackled challenging problems of computational photography on smartphones, such as 
HDR night photography, [under-display camera diffraction mitigation](https://jnjaby.github.io/projects/UDC/), ISP pipeline for next-gen imaging sensor, and [time-of-flight 3D imaging](https://tinyurl.com/itof2dtof/). 

I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Rice University in 2019, working in the 
[Computational Imaging Lab](https://dsp.rice.edu/) and [DSP Group](https://dsp.rice.edu/) at the ECE Department. 
I received my B.S. in Imaging Science (Cum Laude) from [RIT](https://www.cis.rit.edu/) in 2013.
