I'm an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at University of Hawaii at Manoa, where I direct the Computational Imaging
and Robotic Perception Lab.

From 2022 to 2024, I was the founding Computational Imaging Lead at Vayu Robotics, focusing on enhancing autonomous vehicle perception through 
innovative imaging techniques. Vayu is backed by
[Khosla Ventures](https://www.vayurobotics.com/press-releases/vayu-robotics-emerges-from-stealth-with-12-7-million-in-seed-funding-from-khosla-ventures-and-lockheed-martin-ventures), 
and advised by globally renowned AI scientist [Geoffrey Hinton](https://twitter.com/geoffreyhinton/status/1712171599636435105).

From 2019 to 2022, I was with SenseBrain Technology, where I contributed to computational photography on smartphones. 
My team made strides in areas like novel image sensor, [under-display camera tech](https://jnjaby.github.io/projects/UDC/), 
[3D ToF imaging](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~felipe/project-pages/2021-itof2dtof/), 
and [neural image compression](https://github.com/SenseBrain/JPD-SE). 

I obtained my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Rice University in 2019, 
where I explored physics-aware deep learning in computational imaging, 
and obtained my B.S. from RIT in Imaging Science in 2013.
