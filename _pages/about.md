I currently lead the Computational Imaging team at Vayu Robotics, focusing on enhancing autonomous vehicle perception through 
innovative imaging techniques. Vayu is supported by notable VC and industry leader, including 
[Khosla Ventures and Lockheed Martin](https://www.vayurobotics.com/press-releases/vayu-robotics-emerges-from-stealth-with-12-7-million-in-seed-funding-from-khosla-ventures-and-lockheed-martin-ventures), 
and guided by globally renowned AI scientist [Geoffrey Hinton](https://twitter.com/geoffreyhinton/status/1712171599636435105).

From 2019 to 2022, I was with SenseBrain Technology, where I contributed to computational photography on smartphones. 
My team made strides in areas like novel image sensor, [under-display camera tech](https://jnjaby.github.io/projects/UDC/), 
[3D ToF imaging](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~felipe/project-pages/2021-itof2dtof/), 
and [neural image compression](https://github.com/SenseBrain/JPD-SE). 

I hold a Ph.D. from Rice University, where I explored physics-aware deep learning in computational imaging, and a B.S. from RIT in Imaging Science.
