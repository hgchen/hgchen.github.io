I lead the computational imaging team at Vayu Robotics, where we aim to use novel imaging techniques and
apparatus to improve the perception of autonomous vehicles. 

Before Vayu, I was a senior research scientist and tech lead manager at [SenseBrain Technology](https://www.sensebrain.ai/), 
where I worked with [Jinwei Gu](https://www.gujinwei.org) building an R&D team to solve challenging but exciting problem
of computational photography on smartphones. Thanks to my excellent colleagues and interns, we are able to devise state-of-the-art methods 
and datasets for [under-display camera diffraction mitigation](https://jnjaby.github.io/projects/UDC/), 
[time-of-flight 3D transient imaging](https://tinyurl.com/itof2dtof/), [neural image compression](https://github.com/SenseBrain/JPD-SE), 
HDR night photography, and ISP pipeline for next-gen imaging sensors beyond conventional RGB ones.

I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Rice University in 2019, supervised by [Ashok Veeraraghaven](https://computationalimaging.rice.edu/), 
where [my works](/publications) are among the first to leverage deep learning alongside physics-based models for computational imaging. 
I received my B.S. in Imaging Science (Magna Cum Laude) from [RIT](https://www.cis.rit.edu/) in 2013.
