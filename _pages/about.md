I lead the computational imaging team at Vayu Robotics, where we aim to use novel imaging techniques and
apparatus to improve the perception of autonomous vehicles. 

Before Vayu, I was a senior research scientist and tech lead manager at
SenseBrain Technology, tackling challenging problems of computational photography on smartphones, such as 
HDR night photography, under-display camera diffraction mitigation, time-of-flight 3D imaging, and ISP pipeline for next-gen imaging sensor. 

I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Rice University in 2019, working in the 
[Computational Imaging Lab](https://dsp.rice.edu/) and [DSP Group](https://dsp.rice.edu/) at the ECE Department. 
I received my B.S. in Imaging Science (Sum Laude) from [RIT](https://www.cis.rit.edu/) in 2013.
