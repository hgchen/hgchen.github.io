I'm an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM), where I direct the Computational Imaging
and Robotic Perception Lab. I'm looking for 1-2 motivated PhD student with optics/imaging background to join my lab in Spring/Fall 2025.
Please reach out to me if interested!

Prior to UHM, from 2022 to 2024, I was the founding Computational Imaging Lead at Vayu Robotics, focusing on enhancing autonomous vehicle perception through 
innovative imaging techniques. Vayu is backed by
[Khosla Ventures](https://www.vayurobotics.com/press-releases/vayu-robotics-emerges-from-stealth-with-12-7-million-in-seed-funding-from-khosla-ventures-and-lockheed-martin-ventures), 
and guided by Nobel laureate [Geoffrey Hinton](https://twitter.com/geoffreyhinton/status/1712171599636435105). From 2019 to 2022, I was with SenseBrain Technology, where I contributed to computational photography on smartphones. 
My team made strides in areas like novel image sensor, [under-display camera tech](https://jnjaby.github.io/projects/UDC/), 
[3D ToF imaging](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~felipe/project-pages/2021-itof2dtof/), 
and [neural image compression](https://github.com/SenseBrain/JPD-SE). 

I received my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Rice University in 2019, focusing on physics-aware 
deep learning in computational imaging, and my B.S. in Imaging Science from RIT in 2013. 
As a student, I was fortunate to have the opportunities to visit research groups at Cornell, Northwestern, and Brown, and interned at 
NVIDIA Research, IBM, and Light Labs. I also co-founded and led [SenseWatch](https://sense.watch), 
a startup focused on gesture recognition and vital sign monitoring for wearable devices. 
Grateful to my mentors and hosts for their support!
