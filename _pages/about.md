I lead the computational imaging team at Vayu Robotics, where we aim to use novel imaging techniques and
apparatus to improve the perception of autonomous vehicles. 

Before Vayu, I was a tech lead manager at
SenseBrain Technology, tackling challenging computational photography problem for smartphones, such as 
under-display camera, time-of-flight 3D imaging, and ISP pipeline for next-gen imaging sensor. 

I obtained my
Ph.D. degree from Rice University's [Computational Imaging Lab](https://dsp.rice.edu/)/[DSP Group](https://dsp.rice.edu/) in 2019 and my B.S. degree in Imaging Science from [RIT](https://www.cis.rit.edu/) in 2013.
