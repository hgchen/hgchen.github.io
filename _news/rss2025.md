Congratulations to undergraduate capstone students **[Kai Garcia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kai-garcia/)** and **Mairi Yoshioka** for winning the **3rd Place Best Paper Award** (with a $250 prize sponsored by Apple) at the **RSS 2025 Workshop on Navigating Contact Dynamics in Robotics**.

Their project, *PolarTact3D*, uses polarization imaging for single-shot tactile shape and color sensing—an innovative approach to enhancing contact perception in robotic manipulation.
