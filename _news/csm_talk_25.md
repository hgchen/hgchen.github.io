I'll be giving an **invited talk** at the **Colorado School of Mines** on how **visual sensing** can drive productivity in real-world environments such as farms and factory floors.

I will share recent work from our lab on **vision-centric robotic perception**, highlighting the **PIRA Workshop at CVPR 2025** (co-organized with **OpenCV** and **Intrinsic**) on multimodal imaging for industrial automation, our **Farm Robotics Challenge** award-winning farm intelligence system, and **PolarTact3D**, which uses polarization imaging for tactile 3D sensing.
