Congratulations to my undergraduate students for winning the **$10,000 Grand Prize** at the [2025 Farm Robotics Challenge](https://www.hawaii.edu/news/2025/05/13/farm-robotics-challenge-2025-winner/)!

Their AI-powered robot and drone system, developed in collaboration with **Dole Plantation**, automatically counts and sizes pineapples in the field—advancing Hawaiʻi’s smart agriculture and showcasing the innovation and dedication of our UH Mānoa team.
